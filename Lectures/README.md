The expression you provided, $E[(X - E[X])^2]$, represents the expected value of the squared difference between a random variable $ X $ and its expected value $E[X]$. Here's how you can expand it:

1. Start with the expression: $E[(X - E[X])^2]$.
  
2. Expand the square inside the expectation: $(X - E[X])^2 = X^2 - 2X \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2$

3. Take the expected value of the expanded expression. Since $E[X^2]$ and $E[X]^2$ are constants (assuming $X$ is a random variable), you get:
 $E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - 2E[X] \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2$

4. Simplify:
 $E[X^2] - 2E[X] \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2 = E[X^2] - 2(E[X])^2 + (E[X])^2$
 $= E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$

So, $E[(X - E[X])^2]$ simplifies to $E[X^2] - (E[X])^2$. This quantity is known as the variance of the random variable $X$, denoted as $\text{Var}(X)$. Therefore, $E[(X - E[X])^2] = \text{Var}(X)$.

#### What is the solution of $E[E[X]]$ 

In probability theory, \( E[X] \) represents the expected value or the mean of a random variable \( X \). So, \( E[E[X]] \) represents the expected value of the expected value of \( X \).

For a discrete random variable \( X \), \( E[X] \) is calculated by summing the product of each possible value of \( X \) and its corresponding probability. 

Similarly, for a continuous random variable \( X \), \( E[X] \) is calculated by integrating the product of each possible value of \( X \) and its corresponding probability density function (pdf) over the entire range of \( X \).

So, \( E[E[X]] \) simply means taking the expected value of the expected value of \( X \). In most cases, this would be equivalent to \( E[X] \) itself, as taking the expected value twice doesn't change the value.

In short: \( E[E[X]] = E[X] \).
