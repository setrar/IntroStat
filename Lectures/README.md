The expression you provided, $E[(X - E[X])^2]$, represents the expected value of the squared difference between a random variable $ X $ and its expected value $E[X]$. Here's how you can expand it:

1. Start with the expression: $E[(X - E[X])^2]$.
  
2. Expand the square inside the expectation:
   $
   (X - E[X])^2 = X^2 - 2X \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2
   $

3. Take the expected value of the expanded expression. Since $ E[X^2] $ and $ E[X]^2 $ are constants (assuming $ X $ is a random variable), you get:
   $
   E[(X - E[X])^2] = E[X^2] - 2E[X] \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2
   $

4. Simplify:
   $
   E[X^2] - 2E[X] \cdot E[X] + (E[X])^2 = E[X^2] - 2(E[X])^2 + (E[X])^2
   $
   $
   = E[X^2] - (E[X])^2
   $

So, $ E[(X - E[X])^2] $ simplifies to $ E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 $. This quantity is known as the variance of the random variable $ X $, denoted as $ \text{Var}(X) $. Therefore, $ E[(X - E[X])^2] = \text{Var}(X) $.
