    "In statistics, the concept of degrees of freedom (df) refers to the number of values in the final calculation of a statistic that are free to vary. Degrees of freedom are often discussed in the context of various statistical tests or procedures, such as the t-test, chi-square test, or when estimating variances. Here's a simple Julia example that illustrates the concept of degrees of freedom when estimating the sample variance.\n",

    "The formula for the unbiased sample variance ($s^2$) of a dataset involves dividing the sum of squared deviations from the mean by $n - 1$, where $n$ is the sample size. The $n - 1$ term represents the degrees of freedom in this context. This correction is necessary because the sample mean itself is estimated from the data, reducing the degrees of freedom by 1.\n",
